        The SARS-CoV2 pandemic has undoubtedly changed the world as we once knew it 8 months ago. We won't truly know
        which country will win the COVID-19 response prize,
        but we can get a pretty good idea now of who's winning the race. When scrutinizing the a country's response to
        the pandemic, it is important to look not only at objective truths, but facts that matter as well. While some
        leaders claim to be <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">"lower than the world"</a> in some
        areas, it is important to consider the graphs that some politicians would rather not share. The purpose of this
        project is to highlight the important statistics that really matter in evaluating a country's response.

        Some politicians argue that testing too much is a problem and that you can't get new cases without testing.
        Although testing is an important aspect of a country's response, lets play along and try to take the number of
        tests (and number of cases) out of the equation. Luckily, we can do this! Let's compare the percentage of
        positive tests over time in the US, versus other countries.

        This information is far from a perfect one size fits all approach. We can explain much of the results of this
        graph trough logical thinking alone.

        Much of the narritive early on has been around flattening the curve in order keep hospitalizations low as to not
        overwhelm the healthcare systems. If all intensive care units are taken up by COVID-19 patients on ventilators,
        people who need medical attention won't be able to get it. Let's take a look at hospitalization numbers and
        discuss how close they were to overwhelming the healthcare system.
