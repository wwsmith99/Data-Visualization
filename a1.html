    <h1>This is my wonderful HDML page!</h1>
    <p> This is my first web page I have ever written myself. I have previously gone through the entirety of the
        w3schools tutorial in my own time but this is the first time I am putting what I know to use. I am a little
        rusty so this should be some pretty good practice.</p>
    <h1>Interesting visualization of Data</h1>
    <p> About a year ago, I had watched some tutorials on how neural networks process large quatities of information.
        Through my independant research at the time, I found a fantastic visualization of the training process where the
        user was allowed to tinker with the weights and biases of a neural network and watch as it trained itself. The
        website can be found <a
